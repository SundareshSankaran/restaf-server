# Changes

## Version 4.4.0

  - Add support for specifying the host server as VIYA_HOST environment variable. This is the url of the form <protocol>://X.Y.COM. This replaces the SAS_SSL_ENABLED and VIYA_SERVER env variables. SAS_SSL_ENABLED is superseded by the TLS enviornment variable.

  This simplifies the set up of applications.
